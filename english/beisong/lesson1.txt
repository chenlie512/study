a puma at large
puma are large,cat-like animals which are found in American.when reports
came to the London zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of 
London.they were not taken seriously.However ,as the evidence began to accumulate,
experts from zoo felt obliged to investigate,(for the)descriptions given by people who claimed
(to have seen the puma) were extraordinarily similar.
the hunt for the puma began in a small village where a women picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only
5 yards away from her.(it) immediately ran away when she saw it.and experts confirmed that a puma
will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.search proved difficult,(for the puma was often) observed 
(at) a place in the morning,and (at) another place twenty miles alway in the evening.(wherever it went),it left behand it
a trail of dead deers and small animals like rabbits.paw prints were (seen) in a number of places and
puma fur (was found) cling to bushes.several people complained (of) 'cat-like' noises at night and a businessman 
on (a) fishing trip saw the puma up the tree.the experts were (now) fully convinced that (the animal) was a puma,but where had
it came from?as no puma (had been reported) missing from any zoo in the country.(this one) must have been in the possession of 
a private colletor (and somehow manged to escape).the hunter went on (for) several weeks,but puma was not caught.it is disturbing (to think) that  a dangrous wild animal (is still at large) in the quiet countryside.
