the expensive shops in (a famous) arcade near piccaddily were just opening.at this time
(of) the morning,the arcade (was almost) empty.Mr Taylor,the owner of (a) jewellery (shop) was admiring
a (new) window display.(two of his assistants had been) working busily (since eight o'clock) and had (only) just finished.
Diamonds neckleces and rings (had been) beautifully arranged on (a) background of black velvet.
(after) gazing at the display for several minutes.(Mr Taylor) went back into his shop.
the silence was suddenly broken (when) a large car with (its) headlights on and horn (blaring),roaring down
the arcade.it (came to) a stop (outside) the jeweller's,one man stayed at the wheel (while) two others with (black) stockings
over (their) faces jumped out and smashed the windows (of the shop) with iron bars,(while this was) going on,Mr Taylor was
upstairs,he and his staff (began) throwing funiture (out of the window).chairs and tables went (flying)
into the arcade,(one of the thieves) was stuck by a heavy statue,but he was too busy helping himself
to diamons to (notice) any pain.the raid was all over in three minuts,(for the men) scrambled (back) into the car
and it moved off (at a) fantastic speed,(just as it was leaving) Mr Taylor (rushed) out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases,
but (it was impossible to) stop the thieves.they (had got) away with thousands of pounds worth of diamons.
